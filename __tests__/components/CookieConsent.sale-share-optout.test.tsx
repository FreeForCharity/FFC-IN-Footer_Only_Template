/**
 * The sale/share opt-out has to reach the NON-Google tags.
 *
 * Consent Mode governs Google only. Denying `ad_storage` does nothing to the
 * Meta Pixel, which this component loads from `prefs.marketing` alone — so
 * before this contract existed, a visitor who accepted marketing and then used
 * the footer's "Do Not Sell or Share" control got Google advertising denied
 * while Meta kept receiving PageView data and kept its `_fbp`/`fr` cookies.
 * The control's own label said "Advertising sharing is off", which was false.
 *
 * Reported by Copilot on FFC-IN-Footer_Only_Template#140 and on the canary
 * fork; it was real in both, and in the reference template they were copied
 * from.
 *
 * Two properties, because fixing only one leaves the claim false:
 *
 *  1. An opted-out visitor's Pixel is NOT loaded, even with a stored
 *     `marketing: true`. This is also what makes the child-directed
 *     guarantee true for non-Google tags, since `hasSaleShareOptOut()`
 *     returns true whenever that knob is set.
 *  2. Opting out expires the Pixel's cookies, via the same
 *     domain-candidate helper the component uses everywhere else.
 *
 * What is deliberately NOT claimed: a Pixel already executing in the current
 * page cannot be unloaded. Expiring its cookies and refusing to load it again
 * is the honest limit of a client-side control, and the policy text says that
 * rather than promising more.
