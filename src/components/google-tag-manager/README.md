# Google Tag Manager (GTM) Component

This component implements Google Tag Manager integration for the Free For Charity website.

## Overview

Google Tag Manager (GTM) is a tag management system that allows you to manage and deploy marketing tags (snippets of code or tracking pixels) on your website without having to modify the code directly.

## Implementation Details

### Components

1. **GoogleTagManager** - Main component that injects the GTM script into the page

There is deliberately NO `<noscript>` iframe component. It was removed because
it is the one Google request a visitor cannot refuse: with JavaScript disabled
the Consent Mode bootstrap never runs, the cookie banner never renders and the
footer's "Do Not Sell or Share" control does not exist, yet the iframe would
still load the container carrying no consent signal. Its absence is asserted in
`tests/`, so re-adding it fails CI.

### Features

- ✅ Standard GTM implementation following Google's guidelines
- ✅ Initializes `dataLayer` before GTM loads
- ✅ Uses Next.js Script component with `afterInteractive` strategy
- ✅ Integrates with existing cookie consent system
- ✅ GTM ID in `src/lib/analytics.config.ts` (no environment variable needed)

## Configuration

### Setting Your GTM ID

The GTM container ID lives in `src/lib/analytics.config.ts`. To update it:

1. Open `src/lib/analytics.config.ts`
2. Update the `GTM_ID` constant with your actual GTM container ID:

```tsx
// Google Tag Manager ID - Update this with your actual GTM container ID
const GTM_ID = 'GTM-XXXXXXX' // Replace with your actual GTM ID
```

Replace `GTM-XXXXXXX` with your actual GTM container ID from Google Tag Manager (e.g., `GTM-ABC1234`).

## Usage

The component is automatically integrated into the root layout (`src/app/layout.tsx`):

```tsx
import GoogleTagManager from './../components/google-tag-manager'

export default function RootLayout({ children }) {
  return (
    <html lang="en">
      <head>
        <GoogleTagManager />
      </head>
      <body>{/* ... rest of body content */}</body>
    </html>
  )
}
```

## How It Works

### 1. Script Injection

The GTM script is loaded using Next.js's `Script` component with the `afterInteractive` strategy, which means:

- The script loads after the page becomes interactive
- It doesn't block the initial page load
- It's optimal for analytics and marketing tags

### 2. DataLayer Initialization

The GTM script automatically initializes the `window.dataLayer` array with:

- A timestamp (`gtm.start`)
- The initial event (`gtm.js`)

This ensures the dataLayer is ready to receive events as soon as the page loads.

### 3. Cookie Consent Integration

GTM works as a **functional script** and is always active. The existing `CookieConsent` component manages:

- Analytics scripts (Google Analytics, Microsoft Clarity)
- Marketing scripts (Meta Pixel)

When users accept cookies, the `CookieConsent` component pushes a `consent_update` event to the dataLayer, which GTM can use to conditionally fire tags based on consent status.

`marketing_consent` on that event is the **effective** advertising state, not
the banner toggle. A visitor who accepted marketing and then opted out of
sale/sharing — by the footer’s “Do Not Sell or Share” control, by a browser
sending Global Privacy Control, or by this site being configured
child-directed — publishes `marketing_consent: 'denied'`. Key marketing tags
on this value rather than on your own copy of the banner choice; before this
was the case, the event republished the raw preference and a container tag
trusting it fired for an opted-out visitor.

An opt-out made **during** a page pushes `{ marketing_consent: 'denied' }` with
**no `event` key**. GTM merges dataLayer keys, so that corrects the variable
without re-firing `consent_update` — which would re-trigger every tag keyed on
that event and send a duplicate pageview from any whose conditions still hold.

`analytics_consent` is deliberately **not** gated by the opt-out. It is an
opt-out of sale/sharing for advertising, not a withdrawal of the first-party
analytics consent the visitor gave.

### 4. No Noscript Fallback

There is deliberately no `<noscript>` iframe, and this section exists to say so
rather than leave its removal looking like an oversight. With JavaScript
disabled the Consent Mode bootstrap never runs, the cookie banner never
renders and the “Do Not Sell or Share” control does not exist — yet the
iframe would still request the GTM container carrying no consent signal,
which made it the one Google request a visitor had no way to refuse. GA4
cannot run without JavaScript, so it measured almost nothing in exchange.
Its absence is asserted in the test suite, so re-adding it fails CI.

## Testing

Comprehensive tests are available in `tests/google-tag-manager.spec.ts`:

```bash
# Run GTM tests
pnpm run test:e2e tests/google-tag-manager.spec.ts
```

Test coverage includes:

- ✅ DataLayer initialization
- ✅ GTM script loading
- ✅ Absence of the `<noscript>` iframe (asserted, so re-adding it fails CI)
- ✅ Event pushing to dataLayer
- ✅ Cookie consent integration

## Deployment

### GitHub Pages Deployment

The site automatically deploys to GitHub Pages via `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`. The GTM implementation works on both:

1. **GitHub Pages**: the project address for this repository, which is where the site is served while
   no `public/CNAME` exists
2. **Custom domain**: whatever `public/CNAME` names, once one is in service

The GTM ID lives in `src/lib/analytics.config.ts`, so no additional configuration is needed for deployment.
An EMPTY id is supported and means "no container provisioned yet": both components then render nothing
rather than emitting a tag that requests `gtm.js?id=` and fails in the browser.

### Local Development

To test GTM locally:

```bash
# Start development server
pnpm run dev
```

The GTM script will load automatically with the configured GTM ID.

## Debugging

### Verify GTM is Loading

Open your browser's developer console and check:

```javascript
// Check if dataLayer exists
console.log(window.dataLayer)

// Check if GTM script is loaded
console.log(document.querySelector('script[id="gtm-script"]'))
```

### Google Tag Assistant

Use the [Tag Assistant Chrome Extension](https://tagassistant.google.com/) to verify:

- GTM container is loading
- Tags are firing correctly
- Data is being sent to Google Analytics, Ads, etc.

### Preview Mode

In GTM, use Preview mode to:

1. See which tags fire on your pages
2. Debug tag configurations
3. Test before publishing changes

## Security Considerations

- ✅ GTM ID is in `src/lib/analytics.config.ts` (visible in source code)
- ✅ Script uses official Google CDN
- ✅ No sensitive data is sent to GTM by default
- ✅ Integrates with cookie consent for privacy compliance

**Note**: Since the GTM ID is committed and visible in the source code, ensure you're using proper GTM security features like allowlists and container permissions to prevent unauthorized modifications.

## Performance

The GTM implementation is optimized for performance:

- Uses Next.js Script component for optimal loading
- Loads after page becomes interactive (doesn't block rendering)
- DataLayer is initialized early to capture events
- Minimal overhead (~7-10KB for GTM container)

## Troubleshooting

### GTM Not Loading

1. Verify the GTM ID in `src/lib/analytics.config.ts` is correct

2. Check GTM ID format (should be `GTM-XXXXXXX`)

3. Check browser console for errors

### DataLayer Events Not Firing

1. Verify dataLayer is initialized:

   ```javascript
   console.log(window.dataLayer)
   ```

2. Check cookie consent status

3. Use GTM Preview mode to debug

### Ad Blockers

Note: Ad blockers may prevent GTM from loading. This is expected behavior and affects all analytics implementations.

## Updating the GTM ID

To change the GTM container ID:

1. Open `src/lib/analytics.config.ts`
2. Update the `GTM_ID` constant:
   ```tsx
   const GTM_ID = 'GTM-NEW1234' // Your new GTM ID
   ```
3. Commit and push the changes
4. The changes will be deployed automatically via GitHub Actions
